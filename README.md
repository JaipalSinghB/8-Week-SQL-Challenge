# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge
Its my 8 week SQL Challenge Case study 

This is the Danny's Dinner Case study problem. In this case study I identified the problem and try to solve the 10 Business problems like -: 
1) Especially about their visiting patterns
2) How much money theyâ€™ve spent and
3) Which menu items are their favourite  etc.

These questions can help Danny serve his customers more better and personalized way.
DATA SETS ---->>

Danny provided 3 key datasets for this case study:
1) sales -: customer_id, order_date, product_id
2) menu -: product_id, product_name, price
3) members -: customer_id , join_date

DIFFICULTY LEVEL ---->> INTERMEDIATE TO SLIGHTLY ADVANCED
 
TOOL USED ---->> MY SQL
Initially I load the Data set into MY SQL and join all  the tables with  LEFT OUTER JOIN and made another table
which I named Master_table in which I have all the columns from the table so that I dont have to run joins again for every query
and for better query optimization.
